This @PLUGIN@ plugin is an [`its-base`][its-base] based plugin that
integrates Gerrit and [`Storyboard`][storyboard].  The @PLUGIN@ plugin
allows users to configure how a storyboard story and task should be
updated relative to Gerrit change updates.  For example, it can be
configured to automatically add comments to a story when a comment is
entered to an associated Gerrit change.  It can also be configured to
update status on a task when an associated Gerrit change is updated.

[Quick Install Guide][quick].
