This @PLUGIN@ plugin is an [`its-base`][its-base] based plugin that integrates
Gerrit and [`Storyboard`][storyboard].  The @PLUGIN@ allows users
to configure how a storyboard story or task should be updated relative
to Gerrit change updates.  For example, it can be configured to
automatically add comments to a story when a comment is entered to
an associated Gerrit change.  It can also be configured to update a
story's status upon an update to an associated Gerrit change.
